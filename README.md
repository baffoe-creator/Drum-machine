# React Drum Machine

This project is a simple drum machine built with React. It allows users to play various drum sounds by clicking on the on-screen pads or pressing the corresponding keyboard keys. The currently played sound's ID is displayed.

**Key Features:**

* Nine distinct drum sounds.
* Click-to-play functionality for each drum pad.
* Keyboard support for triggering sounds (Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C).
* Display showing the ID of the last played sound.

The `index.html` provides the basic HTML structure to render the React application within the `root` div. It also includes necessary CDN links for React, ReactDOM, and Babel for in-browser JSX transformation. The `app.js` file contains the `DrumMachine` React component, which manages the drum pads, sound playback, and display text.
